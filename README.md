#### [C++ wrapper for the [homebrew](brew.sh) CLI]

&nbsp;

barrel is a C++ library that provides programmatic access to the homebrew command line interface. It can be used to build, for example, GUI frontends or other wrappers around homebrew. It exposes a succinct C++ API, which can be integrated with a wide variety of libraries/tools/frameworks.

barrel is also the library used in my homebrew GUI for macOS: Easybrew
